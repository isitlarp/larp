### READ IMPORTANT INFO BELOW.

Currently, the GitHub repository is empty **(closed source)** and will not be updated at this time. We are planning to expand our services to a paid model (for the general retail), with **free access limited to the X account**. Holders will be able to receive various benefits (TBA). Read more below.

We are making this decision for two main reasons:

1. The service requires a Claude API to function, which obviously cost money. Without access to the Claude API, the service would essentially be non-operational. 
2. Hosting a free, unrestricted checker would result in significant expenses. Therefore, we have decided to make it **free exclusively for the X account.**

Thank you for understanding.
